This plugin allows you to have multiple domains in a single Wordpress installation and enables custom frontpage or redirect for each of them. Can accept any domain, autoconfigure new domains or just accept listed domains. Plugin won't do any configuration on hosting or domain level, so you should take care of that - point domain to the same webroot and configure webserver to accept that.
